# Deno Invoice Application Example

This repo was initially the basic Deno Fresh website demo. I intend to learn
Fresh while build a simple invoicing application. I added
[Dinero.js](https://v2.dinerojs.com/docs) to the importMap to handle monetary
math.

### Usage

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
